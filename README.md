Enlace is a generative art project launched through [Bright Moments Paris](https://app.brightmoments.io/collections/enlace) in February, 2024
Working in collaboration with [Trame](https://trameparis.com/pages/enlace) and [Maision Drucker](https://www.maisonlouisdrucker.com/)


[Enlace](https://arandalaschstg.wpengine.com/project/enlace/) is about bringing together the algorithmic and on-chain potential of the digital token with the time-honored craft of weaving in cane as exemplified by Maison Louis Drucker. Enlace uses digital tools to open a co-creative process with a historic house of craft. New technology and traditional craft are not in conflict. Enlace claims the opposite, that the deep and time-honored traditions of craft use generative processes as part of their making and heritage.

This project is visually expressed using the format of the weaving draft, a conventional template that conveys the minimal and necessary information for weavers to carry out a woven pattern, no matter its size and complexity. It is a graphic language to make a weave, one thread at a time. Visually, this project abstracts this language as the basis for novel generative outputs, altering its representation slightly from convention, while keeping its inherent utility intact. In other words, any weaver, human or machine, will know how to read Enlace as a set of weaving instructions. In this sense, Enlace is not about making a final product, but rather using the token as means to something else; the minimum instructions needed to make either a woven chair or woven canvas.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aranda-Lasch/Enlace
```
or download the zip above

requires a webserver to run, you can use:
python, node, or the VScode Live Server extension

also viewable on our site [here](https://arandalaschstg.wpengine.com/tool/enlace/)

## Usage

/build
contains minified version uploaded to Art BLocks
The Random Seed can be set on line 1234

/src
contains the working files with a GUI


There is no built step, everything was built manually.
